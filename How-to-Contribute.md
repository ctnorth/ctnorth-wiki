## Pull Request Flow

- Please ensure that you fork the SAO repository and work there before submitting a pull request.  This way, your updates based on code review or other feedback show up as updates in the same pull request.  
- Submit all pull requests to `master` branch.

### Pre-request checklist

Please ensure the following before submitting a pull request for your changes:

- The entire solution (<root>\Build\SAO.sln) builds with no errors for all flavors.
- The changed code follows our [code conventions](https://github.com/sanandreasonline/sao/wiki/Coding-Standards).
- All of the CI build jobs pass with no failures.

### After submitting a request

What happens after a pull request is submitted?

- We review the change, and check for code convention or any other issues.
- We verify the change passes build with no errors.

- If the above looks good, the pull request will be accepted, and the change will be merged into the master branch.  Otherwise, we will iterate over the changes with the contributor to work through any issues before accepting the pull request.
